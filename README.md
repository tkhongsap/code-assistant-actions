# FastAPI Project

This is a **FastAPI** project designed to build RESTful APIs with Python. The application is deployed on **Railway** and can be extended to support additional routes and features.

## Features

- FastAPI-based RESTful API framework.
- Powered by Uvicorn for asynchronous request handling.
- Data validation and serialization using Pydantic.
- Easy deployment via Railway.
  
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the FastAPI application locally using Uvicorn:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Deployment on Railway

This application is configured for easy deployment to **Railway**.

### Steps for Deployment

1. Create a new project on Railway and link your GitHub repository.
2. Railway will automatically detect the project and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. The `Procfile` specifies the command Railway should use to run the app:
   
   ```
   web: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

4. In the Railway dashboard, set the following environment variable:

   - **Key**: `PORT`
   - **Value**: `8000` (or your preferred port)

5. After the initial deployment, Railway will provide a public URL for the app. You can use this URL to access the API endpoints.

### Continuous Deployment

Each time you push changes to your GitHub repository, Railway will automatically redeploy the application.

## Updating the Application

As you develop the application further, update the `app/main.py` file with new routes, endpoints, or services. Make sure to test the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`):

- FastAPI: `fastapi==0.68.0`
- Uvicorn: `uvicorn==0.15.0`
- Pydantic: `pydantic==1.8.2`

Install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing the API

After deploying or running the app locally, you can test your API using tools like **Postman** or **curl**.

Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8000/your-endpoint"
```

Replace `/your-endpoint` with the actual route you want to test.
